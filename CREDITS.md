This Flask application was built using guidance from 'Flask Web Development' by Miguel Grinberg. The code examples presented in the book 
are available from GitHub at https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/flasky. Some modules have been borrowed directly from the repository.

Some implementation ideas were taken from Ethan Cerami's tutorial 'Creating Interactive Bokeh Applications with Flask'
